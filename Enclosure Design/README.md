## Enclosure Design

The enclosure design of this solar-powered battery charger and power bank project was a thoughtful endeavor that aimed to achieve a harmonious blend of functionality, aesthetics, and user appeal. We pursued two distinct design approaches, each tailored to different aspects of our charger's personality.

### Design 1 - The 3D Printed Design
For the first design, we focused on practicality and accessibility. This 3D printed enclosure design was characterized by its basic shapes, curves, and ease of manufacturing. We recognized the importance of simplicity in this design, ensuring that it could be easily replicated through 3D printing technology. By incorporating straightforward curves and shapes, we achieved a design that efficiently houses our charger's internal components while enabling seamless assembly. This design approach underscores our commitment to accessibility, making this charger's enclosure accessible to makers and enthusiasts who wish to replicate and personalize the design.

### Design 2 - More Attractive and Moldable Design
The second enclosure design was a testament to the power of creativity and artistic expression. This design emerged from hand-drawn sketches that were translated into a captivating 3D model using Solidworks software. Focusing on enhanced aesthetics, this design incorporated captivating curves, intricate shapes, and visually appealing elements that elevated the overall look of our charger. Beyond aesthetics, this design was conceived with molding in mind. The intention was to create a design that could be readily adapted for mass production through molding processes, adding a layer of practicality to the artistic appeal. This approach showcases our commitment to marrying aesthetics with manufacturability, ensuring that this charger can be produced efficiently without compromising its visual allure.
