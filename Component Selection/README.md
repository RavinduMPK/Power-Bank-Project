## Component Selection

The meticulous selection of components for my solar-powered battery charger and power bank project was a solo endeavor, undertaken with the utmost attention to specifications and performance. Each component was chosen to align with the project's unique requirements, ensuring optimal functionality and user satisfaction.

### BMS IC: MP2651
For Battery Management System (BMS) capabilities, I chose the MP2651 IC. This versatile component not only features fuel gauge functionality but is also compatible with 2 to 4 Li-ion cells. Its I2C communication capability enables seamless integration with other components, allowing for efficient monitoring and control of battery parameters. The MP2651's specifications, such as voltage range, accuracy, and current consumption, perfectly matched my project's demands, making it an ideal choice for safe and effective battery management.

### USB Type-C Port Controller: CCG3PA
The USB Type-C interface, a hallmark of modern connectivity, demanded a controller that could handle the intricacies of Power Delivery (PD) negotiation. My selection, the CCG3PA IC, met this challenge head-on. With its I2C communication interface, it seamlessly managed the complex PD protocol, ensuring efficient and safe power negotiation between devices. The CCG3PA's specifications, including its robust power capabilities and compatibility with multiple charging profiles, aligned perfectly with my project's objectives.

### Power Management Regulator: MP2013A
The power management system, a critical component for ensuring stable and efficient power distribution, found its match in the MP2013A IC. Chosen for its ability to regulate and convert input voltage efficiently, this component contributed to a consistent and reliable power supply throughout the system. The MP2013A's specifications, such as its voltage range, current handling, and efficiency, harmonized seamlessly with my project's power requirements.

### Microcontroller: ATtiny 85
To add intelligence and control to my charger, I turned to the ATtiny 85 microcontroller. Its compact size and efficient capabilities made it an excellent fit for my design. The ATtiny 85's I2C communication interface allowed for seamless interaction with other components, facilitating data exchange and control. Despite its small form factor, this microcontroller's specifications aligned with my project's needs, enabling it to execute the smart charging algorithm and enhance user experience.
