## PCB Design
The printed circuit board (PCB) design of my solar-powered battery charger and power bank project is a testament to precision, optimization, and robust engineering. Crafted using the Altium Designer software, my PCB design represents the backbone of the entire system, ensuring seamless connectivity, efficient power distribution, and signal integrity. Here's a closer look at the meticulous aspects that define my PCB design:

### Software and Considered Interferences
My PCB design journey commenced with the utilization of the powerful Altium Designer software. This tool provided me with a comprehensive platform to conceptualize, design, and refine my PCB layout. Central to my approach was the meticulous consideration of signal interferences. I recognized the critical role that signal integrity plays in the overall system's performance, prompting me to lay the foundation for interference-free communication pathways.

### Careful Routing for High Currents and Inductors
My charger's unique requirements demanded heightened attention to detail during the routing phase. Given the involvement of components with high current demands and the presence of inductors, I approached routing with utmost care. The placement of traces and components was meticulously planned to mitigate current-related challenges and prevent unintended interactions between inductive elements and sensitive circuitry.

### Layer Stack and Optimization
My dedication to achieving optimal performance led me to adopt a 4-layer PCB design. Each layer was strategically designated to fulfill specific purposes. The layer stack was carefully defined to maximize the advantages of each layer:
- Top Layer: Dedicated to power distribution and signal routing, the top layer ensured efficient energy transfer and connectivity.
- Mid Layer 1: A ground plane was assigned to the first mid layer, providing a solid reference point for signal return paths and minimizing interference.
- Mid Layer 2: Like the top layer, the second mid layer was designated for signal routing, enhancing signal integrity throughout the PCB.
- Bottom Layer: This layer was partitioned to accommodate both signal ground and power ground separately, minimizing ground-related disturbances and ensuring stable operation.

### Compact Design with SMD Components
To achieve a compact and efficient layout, my PCB design predominantly relied on Surface Mount Device (SMD) components. The utilization of SMD components allowed me to optimize component placement, conserve space, and enhance thermal management. This approach resulted in a densely packed yet organized design that accommodated the various components seamlessly.
